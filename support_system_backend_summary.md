# Classgrid Support System & Classgrid Talk Summary

This document summarizes the exact state and implementation details of the Classgrid Support System and Classgrid Talk features on the Node.js / Express backend. Use this as context when building the Admin Dashboard or modifying related features.

## 1. Core Endpoints
- **Public Reply (No Auth):** `POST /api/support/public/tickets/:id/reply`
  - Fetches user role dynamically via email.
  - Generates email to Admin.
- **Admin Reply:** `POST /api/support/tickets/:id/reply`
  - If `resolve: true` is passed in the body, it immediately marks the ticket as `resolved` *before* sending the email.
  - Automatically changes status to `in_progress` if not resolved.
  - Pushes an event labeled `<Role> replied` (e.g., "Student replied" or "Admin replied").
- **Admin Update (PATCH):** `PATCH /api/support/admin/tickets/:id`
  - Used for changing status (e.g., to `resolved`), priority, category, or reassigning tickets.
- **Cron Auto-Close:** `GET /api/cron/auto-close-tickets`
  - Closes any ticket that has been `resolved` for more than 7 days. Runs via cron-job.org or Vercel cron.

## 2. Activity History (Event Labels)
In `SupportTicket.events`, we dynamically store the user's role:
- When a user replies, we fetch their account from the DB and push: `label: "Student replied"`, `actorName: "Rahul"`.
- When an admin replies, we push: `label: "Admin replied"`, `actorName: "Nikhil Shinde"`.

## 3. Email Templates (`support-ticket-email.service.js`)
We use Brevo to send emails via a background queue. There are 4 primary emails:

### Normal Support Tickets
1. **Ticket Received:** Sent when a user raises a ticket.
2. **Ticket Replied (Admin to User):** Includes the **Full Activity History**. The history iterates over `ticket.events` and appends `by [actorName]` (e.g., *11:43 PM - Student replied by Rahul*).

### Classgrid Talk (Premium Consultation)
3. **Talk Request Received:** Sent when the user requests a consultation.
4. **Talk Request Replied (Admin to User):**
   - **Crucial Difference:** Talk emails do **NOT** include an Activity History. It is designed to feel like a direct, 1-on-1 email from a specialist.
   - It includes a Conversation Summary, the Specialist's custom message, and a footer with the Specialist's name, avatar, and a **Blue Verified Badge**.
   - It never uses terms like "Ticket" or "Admin replied".

## 4. Pending Cleanup
After final E2E testing, the following temporary scratchpad scripts in the `server/` directory should be safely deleted:
- `test-api-live.cjs`
- `force_resolve.js`
- `read_ticket.js`
- `check_db.js`
- `find_nikhil.cjs`
- `reopen_ticket.js`
- `reply_combined.js`
- `send_4_emails_now.js`
- `instant_reply.js`
- `trigger_reply_local.js`
- `update_ui.js`
- `test-support-emails.js`
- `src/services/classgrid-talk.tmp.js`

## Next Steps
- Build the **Admin Support Dashboard** on the frontend.
- Implement the UI to view the ticket thread and a "Resolve" button that hits the `PATCH /admin/tickets/:id` endpoint.
