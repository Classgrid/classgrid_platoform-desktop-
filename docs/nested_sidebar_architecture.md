# How to Build Nested Sidebar Pages (Vercel Style)

This document explains the architecture we created for the Storage section so that you (or any AI) can easily replicate this "Vercel-style" nested sidebar for future sections like **Settings**, **Organizations**, or **Users**.

## The Goal
To have a single "Back" button in the sidebar (e.g., `< Storage`), and underneath it, a list of tabs (Files, Analytics, S3 Config). Clicking these tabs should change the page content seamlessly *without* reloading the sidebar or losing the sliding animation.

## The Architecture (3 Steps)

### 1. The Reusable Component: `<SlidingSidebar />`
We built a highly reusable core component located at `client/src/components/layout/SlidingSidebar.tsx`. 
This component handles 100% of the CSS transforms, the sliding animations, the "Back" button UI, and the memory of your scroll position. You NEVER have to write CSS animations for the sidebar again.

### 2. The Global Sidebar: `<AppSidebar />`
Located at `client/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`.
This is where we decide *which* nested menu to show based on the URL. 
If the URL is `/superadmin/storage`, we tell the `<SlidingSidebar />` to slide over and reveal the Storage links.

### 3. The Layout Wrapper: `<StorageLayout />`
Located at `client/src/components/layout/StorageLayout.tsx`.
This is a standard React Router layout. It simply renders the global `<DashboardLayout />` and an `<Outlet />`. 
When you click "Files", "Analytics", or "S3 Config" in the sidebar, React Router swaps out the page inside the `<Outlet />` while the layout and sidebar stay completely still.

## How to Create a NEW Nested Section (e.g., Settings)

If you want to build a new nested section (like Settings) with 3 separate pages under one "Back" button, follow these exact steps:

1. **Create the Pages:** Create your 3 separate page files (e.g., `SettingsGeneralPage.tsx`, `SettingsBillingPage.tsx`, `SettingsTeamPage.tsx`).
2. **Create a Layout:** Create a `SettingsLayout.tsx` that looks exactly like `StorageLayout.tsx` (it just renders `<DashboardLayout />` and `<Outlet />`).
3. **Update React Router:** In your router config, make `/superadmin/settings` use the `SettingsLayout`, and add your 3 pages as children routes.
4. **Update AppSidebar.tsx:** 
   - Add a new `showSettingsMenu` state.
   - Use the `<SlidingSidebar />` component to wrap both the main menu and your new Settings menu.

## 🤖 Prompt to Give to AI in the Future

If you want an AI to build a new section for you in the future, just copy and paste this exact message to them:

> "I want to build a new nested section in my sidebar (similar to how we built the Storage section). We have a highly reusable custom component located at `src/components/layout/SlidingSidebar.tsx`. 
> 
> Please use this `<SlidingSidebar />` component inside `AppSidebar.tsx` to handle the new nested menu. It takes the following props:
> - `showNested`: A boolean state to trigger the slide (e.g., based on the current URL route).
> - `onBack`: A function to handle the back button click and slide back to the main menu.
> - `nestedTitle`: The title text for the back button (e.g., 'Settings').
> - `mainMenu`: The JSX containing the main global navigation list.
> - `nestedMenu`: The JSX containing the navigation list for this specific nested section.
> - `activeItemId`: The ID of the item in the main menu that should automatically be smoothly scrolled into view when sliding back.
>
> Finally, create a layout wrapper (like `StorageLayout.tsx`) with an `<Outlet />` so we can render multiple separate pages under this single nested sidebar menu without reloading the page."
