# Canteen Management System Blueprint (Module 22)

The Classgrid Canteen Module is a premium offering designed to eliminate cash-handling chaos, pre-order confusion, and queue bottlenecks during peak college lunch hours. It acts as an internal Swiggy/Zomato specifically tailored for educational institutions.

## Core Objective
To allow students to pre-order and pay for food directly via the Classgrid app, ensuring their order is ready for pickup during break time. Specifically, **payments route directly to the canteen owner's Razorpay account**, absolving Classgrid from accounting liabilities for physical goods. Canteen staff receive orders in a live, real-time Socket.io queue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tenant-Specific Payment Architecture**
> The system will require organizations to input their *own* Razorpay `KEY_ID` and `KEY_SECRET` in the Org Settings (under Canteen configuration). The payment gateway will instantiate using the *tenant's* keys, ensuring funds settle directly into the canteen owner's bank account. Classgrid will neither touch nor hold this money.

## Key Features

1. **Smart Order Aggregation (Kitchen Display):** Instead of showing 14 individual tickets for Vada Pavs scattered across a screen, the system aggregates identical items from the 'NEW' column into a bold top banner: *"🔥 Preparing Now: 14x Vada Pav, 5x Tea"*. This heavily reduces kitchen confusion.
2. **Scan-to-Order (Walk-Ins):** Students who forgot to pre-order can scan a Razorpay QR code at the canteen counter. This routes them instantly to the Classgrid Canteen Menu without navigating menus.
3. **Queue Transparency:** Students can check the app to see their position in the queue (e.g., *"3 orders ahead of yours"*).
4. **Instant Sold-Out Toggles:** Canteen staff can tap a single button to mark an item 'Out of Stock', instantly removing it from the student-facing app to prevent refunds.
5. **Student Canteen Insights:** Students have their own dashboard showing total monthly spending, order history, and the ability to rate items (1-5 stars) after purchase. If a parent asks where their allowance went, the student can just pull up the monthly expense report.
6. **Data-Driven Canteen Analytics:** Admin dashboard tracking top-selling items, highest-rated food, lowest-rated food, and overall student behavior.
7. **Two Operating Modes:** 'Live Kitchen Mode' for large canteens with staff to manage a screen, and a simple 'Digital Token Mode' (Pay & Show Receipt) for small canteens without dedicated screen staff.

## 1. Database Schema Additions (MongoDB)

We will introduce two new collections to handle canteen operations.

### `CanteenItem` Collection
Holds the menu for a specific organization's canteen.
- `_id`: ObjectId
- `orgId`: Reference to Organization
- `name`: String (e.g., "Vada Pav")
- `price`: Number (in INR)
- `category`: String (e.g., "Snacks", "Beverages", "Meals")
- `isAvailable`: Boolean (Toggle to mark item out of stock instantly)
- `imageUrl`: String (Optional)
- `prepTimeAvgMinutes`: Number (To estimate queue times)
- `averageRating`: Number (1-5 scale)
- `totalRatings`: Number

### `CanteenOrder` Collection
Tracks the lifecycle of an individual student's order.
- `_id`: ObjectId
- `transactionId`: String (Razorpay Payment ID / `pay_xxx`)
- `orgId`: Reference to Organization
- `studentId`: Reference to User
- `items`: Array
  - `itemId`: Reference to CanteenItem
  - `quantity`: Number
  - `priceAtPurchase`: Number (Prevents historical price changes from affecting past receipts)
  - `rating`: Number (1-5, Optional)
- `totalAmount`: Number
- `status`: Enum (`['PENDING_PAYMENT', 'NEW', 'PREPARING', 'READY', 'DELIVERED', 'CANCELLED']`)
- `paymentStatus`: Enum (`['SUCCESS', 'FAILED', 'REFUNDED']`)
- `createdAt` / `updatedAt`: Timestamps

## 2. API Endpoints (Node.js/Express)

**Menu Management (`/api/canteen/menu`)**
- `POST /` - Admin creates new item
- `GET /` - Fetch active menu for the org
- `PUT /:id/toggle-availability` - Fast toggle for sold-out items

**Order Lifecycle (`/api/canteen/order`)**
- `POST /create-razorpay-order` - Calculates total server-side, fetches the tenant's Razorpay keys, and generates an order ID.
- `POST /verify-payment` - Verifies the signature, marks the order `NEW`, and emits a Socket.io event to the canteen staff.
- `GET /history/student` - Student views their receipt and total monthly spending.
- `POST /:id/rate` - Student rates the items in an order (1-5 stars).
- `GET /queue/live` - Pre-fetches the day's active queue for the canteen staff dashboard.
- `PUT /:id/status` - Canteen staff updates order status (PREPARING -> READY -> DELIVERED).

---

## 3. Real-Time Engine Integration (Socket.io)

We will leverage the existing `socket.service.js` to create frictionless live updates.

**Socket Events:**
- `canteen_new_order`: Emitted by server when payment succeeds. The canteen dashboard instantly injects the new order card into the 'NEW' column with an alert sound.
- `canteen_status_update`: Emitted when staff mark an order as 'READY'. The student receives a real-time push notification 🔔 "Your order is ready for pickup at Counter A".

---

## 4. Frontend UI Pages (React)

### For Students: Mobile-First Menu Page
**Path:** `/canteen/menu`
- **Tabbed Interface:** The very top of the screen has a toggle: `[ Instant Buy ] | [ Pre-Order ]`.
    - *Instant Buy Tab:* Triggers the "Without Max" walk-up flow. Token is generated instantly for counter presentation.
    - *Pre-Order Tab:* Triggers the "Max Mode" flow. Instructs the student to pick up their food at a specific time (e.g. Lunch Break at 1:00 PM).
- A clean grid of menu items categorised nicely.
- Persistent sticky bottom bar: `Cart: ₹180 | Proceed to Pay`.
- After payment, transitions to an **Order Tracking Screen** showing live status.

### For Canteen Staff: Two Operating Modes (Dashboard Always Active)

Every canteen will have the Dashboard open to track daily revenue and incoming orders. The difference is in *how* they process the queue.

***Mode A: Without Max Mode (Instant Walk-Up)***
Designed for fast, immediate transactions directly at the counter.
- Student pays on the app while standing at the counter.
- Student shows the app generating a large, colorful unique **Token Receipt**.
    - *Token MUST show: Amount Paid, Student Name, Token Number, Item Names, Time of Razorpay payment.*
    - *Token MUST NOT show: PRN (Roll Number).*
- Staff glances at the phone, hands over the food. 
- *Crucially:* The canteen dashboard logs the money and order stats instantly, but the staff **does not need to click anything** to clear the order. It handles it automatically to keep the line moving.

***Mode B: Max Mode (Pre-Order & Tracking)***
Designed for lunch pre-orders placed 15-30 minutes *before* break time.
- Student places a ₹60 Sandwich order while in class.
- The Canteen Dashboard instantly receives the order and payment confirmation.
- The dashboard keeps this order actively pending on the screen.
- When the student physically arrives and shows their token, the staff hands them the sandwich and **manually clicks "Mark Order Completed"**.
- This ensures the canteen knows exactly who has collected their pre-paid food and who hasn't.

### For Admin & Canteen Owner: Data-Driven Analytics
**Path:** `/org/canteen-analytics`
- **Sales Analytics:** Total revenue across days, weeks, and months.
- **Top Performers:** Grid showing the most ordered items (e.g., 2,500 Vada Pavs sold this month).
- **Quality Control:** Insights tracking the highest-rated and lowest-rated items so the canteen can improve food quality based on student feedback.

## 5. Implementation Phases & Walkthrough

1. **Phase 1: Razorpay Tenant Injection**
   Update `payment.service.js` to accept dynamic, per-org Razorpay keys fetched from the database instead of the rigid `process.env` keys.
2. **Phase 2: Database & Menu Setup**
   Build the Mongoose models and the Admin UI to populate the initial menu items.
3. **Phase 3: The Student Cart & Checkout**
   Build the frontend cart state, wire it to the dynamic Razorpay gateway, and successfully insert a `NEW` order record.
4. **Phase 4: The Live Kitchen Display**
   Build the socket-powered Kanban board for the canteen staff and the aggregator logic.

## User Review Required

> [!WARNING]
> Because you want payments to go to the canteen owner, we must store their Razorpay API keys in our MongoDB database. I will encrypt these keys in the database for security using AES-256 before saving them, so even if the DB is compromised, the keys are safe. Do you agree with this approach?
