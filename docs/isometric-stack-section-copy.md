# Isometric Stack Section Copy

Source component reviewed:

`C:\Users\nikhi\OneDrive\Documents\classgrid_marketting\components\sections\IsometricStackSection.tsx`

## What The Component Actually Needs

The component uses one hardcoded array named `PHASES`.

Each phase has this exact shape:

```ts
{
  title: "Line one.\nLine two.",
  body: "One short paragraph.",
  bullets: [
    "Bullet one",
    "Bullet two",
    "Bullet three",
  ],
}
```

The title is split on `\n`, so each title should be two clean lines. The layout has a left text panel around 460px wide and a carousel height of 360px, so keep each body to one sentence and use 3 to 4 bullets.

`LayersSvg.tsx` does not expose editable text labels as props. The practical copy replacement is the `PHASES` array in `IsometricStackSection.tsx`.

## Recommended Section Kicker

Current:

```txt
THE CLASSGRID ERP STACK
```

Keep it. It fits the section well.

## Recommended Headline And Subheadline

**Headline:**

```txt
The connected ERP stack behind every modern campus
```

**Subheadline:**

```txt
ClassGrid unifies admissions, academics, fees, exams, communication, compliance, and AI automation into one live operating system for schools, colleges, and coaching institutes.
```

## Recommended PHASES Content

Use this content to replace the current `PHASES` copy.

```ts
const PHASES = [
  {
    title: "One campus core.\nEvery user connected.",
    body: "ClassGrid gives each institution an isolated workspace where admins, faculty, students, and parents work from the same live campus record.",
    bullets: [
      "Tenant workspaces for schools, colleges, junior colleges, and coaching institutes",
      "Role-based access for owners, principals, HODs, faculty, students, and parents",
      "Organization hierarchy for branches, standards, divisions, batches, and courses",
      "Audit logs and system controls across sensitive workflows",
    ],
  },

    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Academics run from.\nOne daily operating layer.",
    body: "Timetable, attendance, classroom activity, assignments, and teacher planning stay connected instead of living in separate registers.",

  },
  {
    title: "Fees and services.\nSynced to the student record.",
    body: "ClassGrid connects admissions, fee ledgers, online payments, offline receipts, and campus services around one student account.",
    bullets: [

      "Real-time updates through Socket.io, Redis, Firebase, and connected services",
    ],
  },
];
```

## Short Layer Names

If you later add visible labels to the SVG layers, use these compact names:

```txt
Campus Core
Admissions Engine
Academic Operations
Fees & Services
Exams & Compliance
Communication & AI
```
