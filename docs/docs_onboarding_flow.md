# Classgrid - Complete End-to-End Onboarding Flow
### Product-grade, code-verified onboarding spec for a vertical SaaS ERP

---

## Executive Summary

This document now serves **two purposes at once**:
- It is a **code-verified reference** for how onboarding currently works across the marketing site and backend.
- It is a **target operating spec** for what "SaaS-grade onboarding" should mean inside Classgrid.

The current system is already strong because it supports:
- lead capture
- meeting scheduling
- approval and tenant provisioning
- org admin activation
- faculty and student onboarding
- trial provisioning
- hierarchy, admission, fee, and feature-flag setup

That means Classgrid is **well past MVP**. It is not a basic sign-up flow. It is a real institutional onboarding engine.

At the same time, the bar for a **10/10 SaaS onboarding system** is higher than just "many features exist". A 10/10 system is:
- consistent
- self-serve where possible
- safe to retry
- observable end to end
- easy for sales, support, and customers to reason about
- aligned with what the product story promises

---

## Current Maturity Assessment

### Current score: **7/10 SaaS maturity for a vertical ERP product**

### Why it is already strong

The existing onboarding flow solves real institution-scale problems:
- Converts a marketing lead into a live tenant with working credentials and onboarding email flows.
- Creates the organization, admin account, subscription, and join codes in one backend-controlled path.
- Supports multiple institution types with different academic structures.
- Separates org admin, faculty, and student onboarding paths instead of forcing one generic flow.
- Uses activation tokens, role checks, and transactional provisioning patterns.
- Connects onboarding to real ERP setup: hierarchy, subjects, classrooms, fees, admissions, HR, and canteen.

### Why it is not yet 10/10

The main blockers are product-operational, not ambition-related:
- Too many critical steps still depend on Super Admin action.
- Legacy plan logic and newer subscription logic still overlap.
- Some onboarding milestones exist in the schema but were not fully driven by actual events.
- A few implementation details did not fully match the story told in the document.
- The system needs stronger observability, retry safety, and customer-facing progress clarity.

---

## What Was Corrected In Code

The following onboarding issues were fixed during this pass:
- `approveLeadAndProvision()` now defines the plan before building approval email payloads.
- Approval email capacity values now come from actual plan limits instead of broken conditional logic.
- Lead conversion now passes `city` and `state` into organization provisioning.
- Faculty and student join codes are now generated as **different secure codes**.
- `tenant_created` is now marked at organization creation time.
- `first_login_completed` is now marked automatically when the org admin activates the account.
- `admission_form_configured` is now included in onboarding progress calculations.
- `OrgSubscription` now enforces a strict single-plan enterprise model (`demo` -> `active`).
- Join-code regeneration now returns separate `organizationCode` and `honorCode` values.

These fixes make the implementation closer to the product narrative and reduce onboarding-time failure risk.

---

## What "10/10" Means For This Document

This document should now be read with **two layers** in mind:

### Layer 1: Current State
This is the code-verified flow that exists now.

### Layer 2: Quality Bar
A true 10/10 onboarding system for Classgrid must satisfy these standards:
- Every major step is stateful and measurable.
- Every irreversible action is auditable.
- Every provisioning step is safe to retry.
- Every actor knows what to do next without back-channel support.
- Every email, token, code, and status transition maps cleanly to backend state.
- Every onboarding checklist item is driven by actual product events where possible, not only manual toggles.

---

## 10/10 SaaS Design Principles

These are the non-negotiable principles this onboarding flow should ultimately satisfy:

1. **Single source of truth**
   The backend state must always win over documentation, UI assumptions, or ops memory.

2. **Self-serve by default**
   Super Admin intervention should be required only for sales approval, compliance, or exception handling.

3. **Retry-safe provisioning**
   Provisioning should be idempotent so duplicate clicks, queue retries, or partial failures do not corrupt tenant state.

4. **Progress must be real**
   Onboarding completion should be derived from actual milestones such as first login, first hierarchy, first faculty import, and first student activation.

5. **Every transition should be explainable**
   A support agent or sales operator should be able to answer: what happened, when it happened, what failed, and what is blocking go-live.

6. **Security should not fight activation**
   Tokens, join codes, and role checks should be strict, but not so brittle that real customers get stuck during first setup.

7. **Institution-specific flexibility without chaos**
   School, engineering, coaching, diploma, and junior college flows should feel native without introducing inconsistent hidden rules.

---

## 10/10 SaaS Outcome Definition

A "10/10" onboarding outcome for Classgrid means:
- A lead can move from interest to live tenant with minimal manual back-and-forth.
- The principal receives one clean activation path and understands the next three actions clearly.
- The org admin can finish first setup without needing internal team intervention for routine steps.
- Faculty onboarding and student onboarding are secure but friction-aware.
- Sales, implementation, and support can see onboarding state without asking engineering.
- The product can prove where institutions drop off and which steps create the most friction.

## PHASE 1: LEAD CAPTURE (Marketing Website → Backend)

### Step 1.1: School Fills the Demo Form
**Where:** Marketing website (`classgrid_marketting/components/sections/DemoRequestForm.tsx`)
**API Hit:** `POST /api/public/request-demo`

The school principal visits `classgrid.in` and fills the "Request a Demo" form with these **required fields**:
- Institution Name
- Organization Type (School / Engineering / Coaching / Junior College)
- Admin Name (Principal's name)
- Admin Email
- Admin Phone
- State
- City
- Message (optional)

**Security:** The form is protected by **Cloudflare Turnstile** (anti-bot CAPTCHA). The backend verifies the token before accepting the submission.

### Step 1.2: What Happens Instantly After They Submit
**TWO emails are sent simultaneously** (verified from `notification-email.service.js` lines 586-601):

| # | Email Sent To | Email Type | Purpose |
|---|--------------|------------|---------|
| 1 | **You (Super Admin)** at `nikhil.shinde@classgrid.in` | `demo_lead_alert` | Alert: "New Demo Lead: ABC School" with all their details + a link to your Super Admin Dashboard |
| 2 | **The School Principal** (the person who filled the form) | `demo_lead_ack` | Acknowledgment: "Your Classgrid Demo Request Is Received" — A polished welcome email confirming their request |

### Step 1.3: Lead is Saved to Database
**Model:** `DemoRequest` (from `models/DemoRequest.js`)

The lead is stored with status: `"new"` and these fields tracked:
- `meetingStatus: "pending"`
- `status: "new"` (lifecycle: `new` → `contacted` → `closed` → `converted`)
- `convertedAt: null`
- `provisionedOrganizationId: null`

---

## PHASE 2: DEMO MEETING SCHEDULING

### Step 2.1: Self-Schedule (The School Books Their Own Meeting)
**Where:** Marketing website success page (`DemoMeetingCaptureForm.tsx`)
**API Hit:** `POST /api/public/request-demo/:id/meeting-booked`

After submitting the demo form, the school is redirected to a success page where they can **pick a meeting time slot** themselves. They provide:
- Scheduled Date/Time
- Provider (Google Meet / Zoom)
- Meeting URL
- Notes

**Security:** Protected by `DEMO_SCHEDULER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` header validation.

### Step 2.2: What Happens After Meeting is Booked
**TWO more emails are sent** (verified from `notification-email.service.js` lines 669-702):

| # | Email Sent To | Email Type | Purpose |
|---|--------------|------------|---------|
| 3 | **The School Principal** | `demo_meeting_scheduled` | "Demo Meeting Scheduled" with date, time, provider, and meeting link |
| 4 | **You (Super Admin)** | `demo_meeting_scheduled_internal` | "Lead Meeting Confirmed: ABC School" so you know to join the call |

The lead status automatically updates: `"new"` → `"contacted"`

### Step 2.3: Can You (Super Admin) Schedule the Meeting?
**YES.** From your Super Admin Dashboard (`/superadmin/leads/[id]`), you can update the meeting details and the same notification emails will fire.

---

## PHASE 3: APPROVAL & PROVISIONING (The Magic Button)

### Step 3.1: Super Admin Clicks "Approve & Provision"
**Where:** Super Admin Dashboard → Leads → Lead Detail Page
**Service:** `lead-conversion.service.js` → `approveLeadAndProvision()`

The subscription lifecycle is intentionally simple:
- `demo` — a compulsory 31-day onboarding/demo period
- `active` — the single paid production state after demo conversion

Pricing is **not decided in this document**. The product should only communicate that the organization starts on demo and then moves to the paid active state.

### Step 3.2: What the Backend Does Automatically (Atomic Transaction)
The `provisionDemoOrg()` function in `provisioning.service.js` runs inside a **MongoDB transaction** (all-or-nothing):

1. **Normalizes Org Type:** `"college"` → `"engineering"`, validates against allowed list: `school`, `junior_college`, `engineering`, `coaching`, `diploma`, `other`
2. **Resolves Structure Type:** Determines `engineering_with_div`, `school_no_div`, etc. based on org type
3. **Generates Unique Codes:**
   - `organizationCode` — Faculty join code (e.g., `CG-XK7M`)
   - `honorCode` — Student join code (e.g., `CG-P9R2`)
   - `private_code` — Legacy internal code
4. **Creates the Org Admin User Account:**
   ```
   role: "org_admin"
   status: "active"
   mustResetPassword: true    ← Forces password setup on first login
   isEmailVerified: true      ← Pre-verified (no email verification needed)
   authProvider: "manual"
   ```
5. **Creates the Organization Record:**
   - Sets `org_type`, `structure_type`, `division_mode`
   - Sets default branding colors (`#4a90f5` primary, `#8b6fff` secondary)
   - Auto-configures admission form fields based on org type
   - Sets `demoExpiresAt` = 31 days from now
6. **Creates OrgSubscription:**
   ```
   plan: "demo"
   status: "active"
   isPaid: false
   expiresAt: 31 days from now
   ```
7. **Links Admin to Organization:** Sets `organization_id` on the admin user

### Step 3.3: Generates Secure Activation Token
```javascript
const rawActivationToken = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
// Hashed with SHA-256 before storing in DB
admin.activationToken = hashedActivationToken;
admin.activationTokenExpires = new Date(Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000); // 5 MINUTES ONLY
```

### Step 3.4: The BIG Email is Sent (Email #5 — The Most Important One)
**Template:** `getConsolidatedApprovalEmailHtml()` (lines 1673-1845 of `email-templates.service.js`)

This is a **massive, professionally designed email** that contains EVERYTHING the Org Admin needs:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 🎉 Header | "[Org Name] is now live on Classgrid" |
| 📊 Plan Info | Current subscription state, demo window, and capacity details |
| 🏫 Organization Codes | **Faculty Code** (blue, with "Do not share with students" warning) + **Student Honor Code** (green) |
| 🚀 Getting Started | Step-by-step: How to invite Faculty, How Students join |
| 🔑 Activation Button | **"Activate Admin Account"** — Single-use link, expires in 5 minutes |
| 🎛️ Dashboard Link | **"Open Org Admin Dashboard"** — Premium gradient button to bookmark |

### Step 3.5: Lead Status Updated
```javascript
lead.status = "converted";
lead.convertedAt = new Date();
lead.provisionedOrganizationId = organization._id;
lead.provisionedAdminId = admin._id;
```

---

## PHASE 4: ORG ADMIN ACCOUNT ACTIVATION

### Step 4.1: Principal Clicks "Activate Admin Account" in Email
**URL:** `https://classgrid.in/admin/activate?token=<64-char-hex-token>`
**API Hit:** `POST /api/auth/validate-activation-token`

The backend:
1. Hashes the token from the URL with SHA-256
2. Looks up `User` where `activationToken === hashedToken` AND `activationTokenExpires > now`
3. If valid → shows the "Set Password" form
4. If expired → shows "Token expired, request a new one"

### Step 4.2: Principal Sets Their Password
**API Hit:** The activation endpoint in `auth.controller.js`

```javascript
user.password = newHashedPassword;
user.activationToken = null;           // Token is destroyed (single-use)
user.activationTokenExpires = null;
user.mustResetPassword = false;        // Account is now fully activated
await user.save();
```

### Step 4.3: Principal Lands on Org Admin Dashboard
They are now logged in and redirected to `/org/dashboard` — their master control panel.

**Total Emails Sent So Far: 5**

---

## PHASE 5: ORG ADMIN INITIAL SETUP (Everything They Must Configure)

Once the Org Admin is inside the dashboard, they need to configure **8 major setup categories** before the platform is fully operational. The backend tracks their progress via the `onboarding_progress` object in the Organization model.

### ✅ Onboarding Progress Tracker (Built into the Database)
```
onboarding_progress: {
    tenant_created: true/false,
    branding_configured: true/false,
    academic_hierarchy_set: true/false,
    staff_imported: true/false,
    students_imported: true/false,
    fee_structure_configured: true/false,
    admission_form_configured: true/false,
    first_login_completed: true/false,
    completed_at: Date
}
```

---

### 5.2: 🏗️ Academic Hierarchy Structure (`/org/settings/branches`)

This is the **most critical** setup step. It defines how the entire institution is organized.

**Organization Type** (`org_type`): Determines the base hierarchy:

| Org Type | Structure Options | Hierarchy |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| `engineering` | `engineering_with_div` / `engineering_no_div` | Degree → Dept → Year → Semester → Division/Batch |
| `school` | `school_with_div` / `school_no_div` | Standard → Division |
| `junior_college` | `junior_college_with_div` / `junior_college_no_div` | Stream → Standard → Division |
| `coaching` | `coaching` | Course → Batch (NO divisions, NO semesters) |
| `diploma` | `diploma_with_div` / `diploma_no_div` | Dept → Year → Semester → Division |

**Division Mode** (`division_mode`):
- `with_divisions`: Students are split into Division A, B, C
- `without_divisions`: Auto-creates a single "Default Division"

**Sub-Batch Support** (`allow_sub_batches`):
- Engineering/Diploma only: Splits Division A into Lab Batch A1, A2 for practical sessions

**Academic Config** (`academic_config`):

| Setting | Purpose | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `identifierLabel` | What students call their ID number | "PRN" / "Roll No" / "Enrollment No" |
| `prnRequired` | Is the ID number mandatory? | true/false |
| `prnLocked` | Lock PRN after first submission? | true/false |
| `batches` | Academic admission years | ["2022-2026", "2023-2027"] |
| `branches` | Departments/Streams | ["Computer", "IT", "Mechanical"] |
| `requiredFields.prn` | Is PRN required for profile completion? | true/false |
| `requiredFields.batch` | Is batch required? | true/false |
| `requiredFields.branch` | Is branch required? | true/false |
| `idCardFields` | What shows on ID card | ["prn"] / ["rollNo"] / ["both"] |

| `paymentAmount` | Amount paid |
| `demoExpiresAt` | When the 31-day trial expires |
| `is_promoting` | Lock flag during academic year promotion |
---

### 5.11: 🌳 CREATING THE ACTUAL ACADEMIC RECORDS (The Operational Setup)

> This is what you asked about — Divisions, Standards, Courses, Batches, Subjects, Faculty assignments, Classrooms, Timetable. These are NOT just config. These are **real database records** the Org Admin creates AFTER the config is set.

#### 📦 Model: `AcademicHierarchy` — The Universal Tree

Every academic unit (Department, Division, Standard, Batch, Course) is a **tree node** stored in one unified model. Nodes are linked via `parent_id` to form a nested hierarchy.

**Node Types Available** (`level_type` enum):

| Level Type | Used By | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `degree` | Engineering | B.Tech, M.Tech |
| `department` | Engineering, Diploma | Computer Engineering, IT, Mechanical |
| `year` | Engineering, Diploma | First Year, Second Year, Third Year |
| `semester` | Engineering, Diploma | Sem 1, Sem 2, ... Sem 8 |
| `division` | ALL (except coaching) | Division A, Division B, Division C |
| `sub_batch` | Engineering, Diploma | Lab Batch A1, A2 (under Division A) |
| `standard` | School, Junior College | Class 1, Class 10, 11th, 12th |
| `stream` | Junior College | Science, Commerce, Arts |
| `course` | **Coaching** | JEE Advanced, NEET, MHT-CET |
| `batch` | **Coaching** | Morning Batch, Evening Batch, Weekend |
| `group` | Custom | Level 1, Level 2 |
| `sub_group` | Custom | Group A, Group B |

**Each Node Has:**
```
{
    organization_id: ObjectId,
    level_type: "department",
    name: "Computer Engineering",

#### 🔧 API Endpoints for Hierarchy CRUD

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/hierarchy/node` | Create a new node (department, division, etc.) |
| `GET` | `/api/hierarchy/tree` | Get full nested tree for the org |
| `GET` | `/api/hierarchy/tree?flat=true` | Get flat array of all nodes |
| `GET` | `/api/hierarchy/children/:parentId` | Get direct children of a node |
| `PATCH` | `/api/hierarchy/node/:nodeId` | Update name, code, sort_order |
| `DELETE` | `/api/hierarchy/node/:nodeId` | Soft-delete node + all descendants |
| `POST` | `/api/hierarchy/seed` | Auto-seed default structure (one-time, during onboarding) |
| `GET` | `/api/hierarchy/terminology` | Get the dynamic label dictionary |

#### 🧠 Auto-Seed: One-Click Default Structure

When the Org Admin first opens the hierarchy page, they can click **"Seed Default Structure"** which calls `POST /api/hierarchy/seed`. This auto-creates:

| Org Type | What Gets Auto-Created |
|----------|----------------------|
| Engineering | B.Tech → 4 Departments (CE, IT, ENTC, ME) → First Year → Sem 1 → Division A |
| School | Class 1 through Class 10 → Division A & B each |
| Coaching | JEE Advanced, NEET, MHT-CET → Morning & Evening Batches |
| Junior College | Science, Commerce, Arts → 11th & 12th → Division A & B |
| Diploma | CE, ME, Civil → First Year → Sem 1 → Division A |

#### 🔇 Auto-Division for "No Division" Plans

When `structure_type` is `school_no_div`, `engineering_no_div`, etc., the system **automatically creates a hidden "Default" division** whenever the admin creates a standard or semester node. The UI hides this division so it feels like there's no division at all.

### 5.12: 📚 SUBJECTS (What Students Study)

**Model:** `OrgSubject`

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `organization_id` | ObjectId | Tenant isolation |

### 5.17: 💰 FEE SETUP (Three-Layer Architecture)

The fee system has **3 layers**:

**Layer 1: Fee Category** (top-level grouping)
```
FeeCategory {
    name: "Academic Fees",
    organizationId: ObjectId,
    description: "All tuition-related charges"
}
```
Examples: "Academic Fees", "Infrastructure Fees", "Miscellaneous"

**Layer 2: Fee Component** (individual fee heads)
```
FeeComponent {
    name: "Tuition Fee",
    categoryId: ObjectId → FeeCategory,
    organizationId: ObjectId,
    defaultAmount: 50000
}
```
Examples: "Tuition Fee", "Library Fee", "Lab Fee", "Development Fee", "Exam Fee"

**Layer 3: Fee Structure** (template combining components)
```
FeeStructure {
    name: "FY Computer Engineering - Open Category",
    organizationId: ObjectId,
    components: [
        { componentId: ObjectId, amount: 50000 },  // Tuition
        { componentId: ObjectId, amount: 5000 },   // Library
        { componentId: ObjectId, amount: 3000 }    // Lab
    ],
    totalAmount: 58000,
    academicYear: "2025-26",
    isActive: true
}
```

---

### 5.18: 🗣️ DYNAMIC TERMINOLOGY SYSTEM (The Magic Labels)

The entire UI **adapts its language** based on org type! The backend has a `terminology.js` dictionary that sends the correct labels to the frontend:

| Label Key | Engineering | School | Coaching | Jr College | Diploma |
|-----------|------------|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| `org_label` | College | School | **Institute** | Junior College | Polytechnic |
| `top_level` | Degree | Standard | **Course** | Stream | Department |
| `course` | Branch | Class | **Course** | Stream | Branch |
| `year` | Year | Class | **null** ❌ | Standard | Year |
| `period` | Semester | Term | **null** ❌ | Term | Semester |
| `division` | Division | Section | **null** ❌ | Division | Division |
| `sub_batch` | Lab Batch | null | null | null | Lab Batch |
| `student_id` | PRN | Roll No | **Enrollment No** | Roll No | Enrollment No |
| `teacher` | Faculty | Teacher | **Mentor** | Lecturer | Faculty |
| `classroom` | Classroom | Classroom | **Batch** | Classroom | Classroom |
| `add_student` | Register Student | Add Student | **Enroll Student** | Add Student | Register Student |
| `add_teacher` | Add Faculty | Add Teacher | **Add Mentor** | Add Lecturer | Add Faculty |
| `assignment_label` | Assignment | **Homework** | **Practice Set** | Assignment | Assignment |
| `exam_label` | Examination | **Test** | **Mock Test** | Examination | Examination |
| `forum_label` | Forum & Discussion | Student & Parent Board | **Doubt Forum** | Discussion Forum | Forum & Discussion |
| `parent_comm` | Student Communication | **Parent Communication** | Student Communication | Student Communication | Student Communication |

**Notice for Coaching:** Year, Semester, and Division are all **`null`** — the system completely blocks these features! Coaching only has Course → Batch. No divisions, no semesters.

---

### Method 1: Individual Invite (From Org Admin Dashboard)
**Route:** `/org/faculty` → "Add Faculty" button
**What happens:**
1. Org Admin enters: Name, Email, Phone, Role, Department
2. Backend creates User with `mustResetPassword: true`
3. **Email #6** is sent: Faculty invitation with activation link
4. Faculty clicks link → Sets password → Enters **Faculty Organization Code** → Lands on Faculty Dashboard

### Method 2: Bulk Excel Upload (The CSVImportMappingWizard)
**Route:** `/org/faculty` → "Import from Excel" button
**What happens:**
1. Org Admin uploads `.xlsx` file with columns: Name, Email, Phone, Role, Department
2. Backend runs `import-validation.service.js` → validates all 34 roles, checks for duplicates
3. Shows preview: X valid, Y invalid, Z duplicates
4. On "Commit" → creates all accounts with `mustResetPassword: true`
5. **Bulk emails sent** to each faculty member with their activation links

---

## PHASE 7: ONBOARDING STUDENTS

### Method 1: The "Auto-Match" vs "Waitlist" Flow (Security Gate)
Because the Honor Code can be shared publicly, the backend enforces strict validation:

1. Student visits Classgrid login page.
2. Creates an account with Google OAuth or Email/Password.
3. Enters the **Student Honor Code** to link to the Organization.
4. **Mandatory Profiling:** The student enters the **13-Step Profile Onboarding** (`/profile/onboarding`). They submit their PRN, Name, DOB, and academic details.
5. **Backend Verification Engine:** 
   - **Scenario A (Instant Onboarding):** The backend checks if the Admission Department uploaded an Excel/CSV file containing this student's data (`import-validation.service.js`). If the submitted `PRN`, `DOB`, and `Name` **match exactly** with the pre-seeded DB record, the student is instantly granted `verification_status: 'verified'` and the full ERP opens immediately.
   - **Scenario B (Waitlist):** If the data does **NOT** match the Excel file (e.g. typos, or they are an imposter, or no Excel was uploaded), the backend forces `verification_status: 'pending'`. The student is trapped on the Waitlist.
6. **Waitlist State:** While on the waitlist, the student cannot access classrooms, exams, or the fee portal.
7. **Admin Approval:** The Org Admin must manually review the waitlisted student's ID card and click "Approve" to unlock the ERP.

### Method 2: Faculty Creates Classroom → Shares Classroom Code
1. Faculty creates a new Classroom from their dashboard
2. System generates a unique **Classroom Code**
3. Faculty shares this code in class
4. Students enter the code → Auto-linked to Organization AND Classroom

### Method 3: Bulk Import by Org Admin
1. Same Excel upload flow as Faculty
2. Backend creates student accounts with `role: "student"` and `mustResetPassword: true`
3. Each student receives activation email

### Method 4: Admission Module Auto-Enrollment
1. When admission is approved via `/dept/admissions/enroll`
2. System auto-creates student account
3. Generates PRN/Roll Number
4. Sends welcome email with activation link

## PHASE 8: PAYMENT & SUBSCRIPTION

### Current State (Code-Verified):
- All organizations start on the **"demo" plan** → `isPaid: false`, expires in **31 days**
- The demo gives them full access to set up the system and onboard their users.
- *Note: Pricing is intentionally not defined in this document yet. The current product story is: compulsory 31-day demo first, then one paid active state.*

---

## COMPLETE EMAIL TIMELINE (Per Organization)

| # | When | To Whom | Email Subject |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Demo form submitted | **Super Admin** | "New Demo Lead: [School Name]" |
| 2 | Demo form submitted | **School Principal** | "Your Classgrid Demo Request Is Received" |
| 3 | Meeting booked | **School Principal** | "Demo Meeting Scheduled" |
| 4 | Meeting booked | **Super Admin** | "Lead Meeting Confirmed: [School Name]" |
| 5 | Approved & Provisioned | **School Principal** | "Activate Your Classgrid Admin Account" (THE BIG EMAIL with codes + activation link) |
| 6+ | Faculty invited | **Each Faculty** | Faculty invitation with activation link |
| 7+ | Plan expiring | **Org Admin** | "Plan Expiring Soon / Expired" |

---

## SECURITY ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Anti-Bot | Cloudflare Turnstile on demo form |
| Token Security | SHA-256 hashed activation tokens, 5-minute expiry, single-use |
| Password | `mustResetPassword: true` flag blocks API access until password is set |
| Role Guard | `requirePasswordSet` middleware blocks org_admin if `mustResetPassword === true` |
| Webhook Auth | `DEMO_SCHEDULER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` header for meeting callbacks |
| Database | MongoDB transactions for atomic org provisioning (all-or-nothing) |


---

## 10/10 SaaS Gap Checklist

The system becomes truly best-in-class when the following are complete:

### Product and ops
- Self-serve scheduling, activation, and initial setup require less sales intervention.
- The onboarding UI clearly shows the next best action for org admins.
- Sales, implementation, and support share the same onboarding status view.
- Demo-to-paid conversion logic is separated cleanly from technical provisioning logic.

### Engineering and platform
- Provisioning is idempotent and safe to retry.
- Email dispatch failures cannot leave provisioning in an unclear state.
- Join-code regeneration is fully audited and rotation-aware.
- Every critical onboarding action emits structured audit events.
- Subscription state, feature flags, and plan limits are resolved from one canonical source.

### Analytics and observability
- Time-to-first-login is tracked.
- Time-to-first-hierarchy-created is tracked.
- Time-to-first-faculty-import is tracked.
- Time-to-first-student-verified is tracked.
- Trial-to-setup completion and setup-to-usage conversion are measurable.
- Failed provisioning attempts are visible without log-diving.

### Customer experience
- The org admin can always tell what is done, what is blocked, and what is next.
- The setup checklist is driven by real actions, not only manual toggles.
- Error states explain recovery steps clearly.
- Invitation emails, activation emails, and setup screens use one consistent product language.

---

## Recommended Next Build Order

If the goal is to move this from **7/10 to 10/10**, this is the highest-value build order:

1. **Canonical onboarding state machine**
   Create one backend-owned status model for lead -> meeting -> approved -> provisioned -> activated -> setup_in_progress -> go_live_ready.

2. **Idempotent provisioning and retry protection**
   Ensure duplicate approve clicks, queue retries, or partial email failures cannot create ambiguous org state.

3. **Customer-facing onboarding checklist powered by real events**
   Auto-complete steps from actual actions like activation, hierarchy seed, faculty import, fee setup, and first verified student.

4. **Unified subscription and feature-resolution layer**
   Remove remaining overlap between legacy plan behavior, `OrgSubscription`, and feature flags.

5. **Operational dashboards and conversion analytics**
   Measure where schools drop off, how long activation takes, and which step most often delays go-live.

6. **Exception handling and support tooling**
   Add internal tools for resend activation, reprovision safely, rotate codes safely, and explain blocked onboarding states instantly.

---

## Final Verdict

Classgrid already has the bones of a serious vertical SaaS onboarding engine.

What makes it promising is not just the number of steps. It is that the onboarding is tied to **real tenant creation, real academic structure, real role flows, and real ERP readiness**.

What will make it truly **10/10** is discipline:
- one source of truth
- fewer manual dependencies
- stronger state tracking
- better retry safety
- better visibility
- and a customer journey that feels as polished as the backend is ambitious

That is the standard this document should now be used to enforce.
