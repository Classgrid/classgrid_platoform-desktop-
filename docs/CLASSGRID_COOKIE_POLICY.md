## 1. WHAT ARE COOKIES?

Cookies are small text files that are placed on Your device (computer, smartphone, tablet) when You visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently, provide a better user experience, and give website owners useful information.

### Types of Storage Technologies We Use:
- **Cookies** — Small text files stored in Your browser
- **Local Storage** — Browser-based storage that persists until explicitly cleared
- **Session Storage** — Browser-based storage that is cleared when the browser tab is closed
- **JWT Tokens** — Encrypted authentication tokens stored in browser memory or local storage

---

## 2. HOW WE USE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

We use cookies and similar technologies for the following purposes:

### 2.1 Strictly Necessary (Essential)
These are required for the Platform to function. Without these, You cannot log in, navigate, or use core features. **These cannot be disabled.**

| Cookie/Technology | Purpose | Duration | Type |
|---|---|---|---|

| `refresh_token` | Used to silently refresh expired authentication tokens | 30 days | HTTP-Only Cookie |

### 2.2 Functional
These enhance Your experience by remembering preferences and settings. **You may disable these, but some features may not work optimally.**

### 2.3 Performance and Analytics
These help Us understand how Users interact with the Platform, identify errors, and improve performance. **No personally identifiable information is collected through these technologies.**

### 2.4 What We Do NOT Use
We want to be completely transparent:

- ❌ **No advertising cookies** — We do not serve ads on the Platform

## 3. COOKIES ON TENANT WEBSITES

Tenant websites (e.g., collegename.classgrid.in) use a minimal set of cookies:

| Cookie/Technology | Purpose | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant_theme` | Stores the tenant's custom primary color for consistent rendering | Session |
| `visitor_session` | Anonymous session tracking for visitor count analytics (no PII) | Session |

Tenant websites do **not** place any third-party tracking, advertising, or analytics cookies unless the Tenant Organization has explicitly integrated external services (e.g., Google Analytics through custom code, which is not provided by Classgrid by default).

**Note:** If a tenant website embeds YouTube videos or Google Maps, those third-party services may set their own cookies. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details on their cookie practices.

---

## 4. COOKIES ON THE MOBILE APP

The Classgrid mobile application (Android/iOS) does **not** use traditional browser cookies. Instead, it uses:

- **Secure Token Storage** — Authentication tokens (JWT) are stored in the device's secure storage (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain)
- **App Preferences** — User preferences (theme, notification settings) are stored using the device's native preferences system (SharedPreferences on Android / UserDefaults on iOS)

These are functionally equivalent to cookies but are managed entirely within the mobile app's sandboxed environment and are not accessible by other apps or websites.

---
