# 🏗️ CLASSGRID MASTER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN v3.0
**The Single Source of Truth — All 3 Projects, All Features, All Timelines**

> **Last Updated:** April 9, 2026
> **Author:** Nikhil + Sorra (Antigravity AI)
> **Status:** ACTIVE — Days 1-4 COMPLETED.

---

# 🏁 DAY 1 KICKOFF: THE GREAT PLATFORM SPLIT (TOMORROW)
**Objective:** Transform Classgrid from a single app into a 4-path Identity Engine.

### 1. Backend Core (The Identity Database)
*   **Target:** `server/src/models/Organization.js`
*   **Action:** Add `org_type` and `division_mode` to the schema.
    ```javascript
    org_type: { 
      type: String, 
      enum: ["school", "junior_college", "engineering", "coaching", "diploma", "other"],
      required: true 
    },
    division_mode: { 
      type: String, 
      enum: ["with_divisions", "without_divisions"],
      default: "with_divisions" 
    },
    allow_sub_batches: { type: Boolean, default: false } // For Engineering lab batches
    ```

#### 🗓️ Day 1 Goal: The 7 Organizational Profiles
**The most critical backend system. Every model, classroom, and fee structure depends on this.**

| Plan | Type | Hierarchy Structure | Key Backend Logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Plan 1** | College / Engineering | `Degree → Dept → Year → Sem → Div/Batch` | Requires `semester_id` + `division_id` |
| **Plan 2** | School (With Div) | `Standard → Division` | Grade + Division structure |
| **Plan 3** | School (No Div) | `Standard` only | Auto-creates hidden "Default Division" |
| **Plan 4** | Coaching Classes | `Course → Batch` | Blocks divisions & semesters entirely. |
| **Plan 5** | Junior College | `Stream → Standard → Division` | Enforces 11th/12th grade boundary |
| **Plan 6** | Diploma | `Dept → Year → Semester` | No Degree layer, Semester-locked |
| **Plan 7** | Other (Custom) | Open-ended grouping | Flexible, user-defined hierarchy |

- [x] Build `AcademicHierarchy.model.js` with the `structure_type` enum for all 7 plans.
- [x] Write dynamic parser middleware: If a Coaching class requests "Semesters" → `400 Bad Request`.
- [x] Wire `AuthContext` to read `structure_type` from JWT → Frontend Sidebar hides/shows "Divisions" vs "Batches".
- [x] Test every plan via Postman: Create Org → Set structure_type → Verify allowed/blocked nested routes.

### 2. The Multi-Track Dictionary (Terminology)
*   **Target:** `server/src/utils/terminology.js` (New File)
*   **Action:** Create a standard dictionary that returns the correct word based on `org_type`.
*   **Mapping:**
    *   **Engineering:** "Branch" / "Semester" / "Division"
    *   **School:** "Class" / "Section" / "Division"
    *   **Coaching:** "Course" / "Batch" / "Batch"
    *   **Junior College:** "Stream" / "Class" / "Division"

### 3. Admission Strategy Split
*   **Target:** `server/src/services/admissions/strategy-selector.js`
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **IF Engineering:** Load `CETAllotment` + `RLA_Flow`.
    *   **IF School:** Load `MeritCalculation` + `Normalization`.
    *   **IF Coaching:** Load `BatchSelection` + `DiscountLogic`.

### 4. Admin Dashboard Personalization
*   **Target:** `client/src/context/OrgContext.jsx`
*   **Action:** Provide `branding` and `terminology` globally.
*   **Result:** The sidebar and buttons automatically change (e.g., "Add Student" vs "Register Applicant").

---# Stitch Design Flow & Strict Shadcn Rules

====================================================================
🚨 BIG NOTES: THE GREAT REBUILD 🚨
====================================================================
MANDATE: We are rebuilding ALL pages from SCRATCH (Except the Home Page).
When opening Classgrid, the Home Page is good. From that point on, EVERYTHING is rebuilt.

THE STRICT 4-STEP REBUILD PIPELINE:
1. STITCH DESIGN (Theme, Colors, OKLCH, Variables)
2. FIGMA (Layout, Structure, Spacing)
3. SHADCN COMPONENTS (Assemble primitives from @/components/shadcn)
4. CONNECT BACKEND / API (Wire up the data, React Router, and Context)

NEVER deviate from this order when building a new page.
====================================================================
Before doing anything, follow these strict rules:

1. You are ONLY allowed to use existing shadcn components from:
   client/src/components/shadcn/

2. Allowed components list (strict):
   button, input, label, card, form, toast, dialog, alert, checkbox, radio-group, select, separator, tabs, badge, avatar, dropdown-menu, sheet, skeleton, switch, textarea, accordion, alert-dialog, aspect-ratio, breadcrumb, calendar, carousel, chart, collapsible, combobox, command, context-menu, table, popover, drawer, hover-card, input-otp, kbd, menubar, navigation-menu, pagination, progress, resizable, scroll-area, slider, sonner, spinner, toggle, toggle-group, tooltip, toaster

3. DO NOT:
   * create new components
   * use @base-ui/react
   * use useRender or mergeProps
   * add random Tailwind styles outside components
   * redesign UI or change structure

4. If a required component is:
   * missing
   * not found
   * not installed
   THEN:
   STOP immediately and say:
   "Component [name] not found. Please install it first."
   DO NOT create a replacement.
   DO NOT continue without it.

5. Before writing code, you MUST confirm:
   "I will only use allowed shadcn components and follow all rules."
   If any rule is broken, stop and fix before continuing.

6. STRICT RULE: NEVER remove, refactor, or "clean up" my existing code unless I specifically ask you to. You must ONLY make surgical changes to the exact lines required to fix the issue. My current system is already built and functioning—do not break my edge cases.

7. ARCHITECTURE RULE: Raw UI components stay in `src/components/shadcn/`. Business logic and complex assembled components (like an `<AssignmentSubmitButton />`) must be built in `src/components/features/` and import their base UI primitives from `shadcn/`.

---

# Our Core Technology Stack & Development Flow

Step 1: The Three Pillars
* FIGMA: Used strictly for LAYOUT. (Spacing, paddings, margins, grid structures).
* STITCH: Used strictly for DESIGN. (Colors, themes, border styles, gradients, visual tokens).
* SHADCN: Used strictly for COMPONENTS. (Tables, notification bars, buttons, forms, inputs, etc.).

Step 2: Design Ingestion
I will actively read your Figma layout and your Stitch design tokens using the MCP integrations to understand your exact visual and structural blueprint.

Step 3: Component Sourcing
The user provides base component code directly from the official shadcn/ui website (e.g. Table, Alert/Notification bar, Button).

Step 4: Surgical Styling
I will surgically inject the Stitch-defined design colors and the Figma-defined spacing into the allowed Shadcn components to match your vision perfectly.

Step 5: Backend Wiring
I will wire the styled React UI components to the existing Express.js backend without altering any existing business logic.


## 🤖 INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS (READ THIS FIRST)

> **If you are an AI (ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Antigravity, or any other assistant) reading this file, you MUST follow every rule below. Nikhil has spent weeks architecting these decisions. Breaking them will destroy the project.**
> **PERSONA:** The user has officially named this AI instance **Sorra**. You are to carry this identity throughout the Classgrid project.

### ⛔ NEVER DO THESE THINGS:
1. **NEVER deploy to or suggest Vercel.** We use **AWS EC2 only**. Vercel kills WebSockets, has 10s timeouts, and exhausts DB connections. This was tested and rejected.
2. **NEVER rewrite files to TypeScript (.tsx).** The project launches with JavaScript (.jsx). Do NOT halt momentum for a TS migration.
3. **NEVER install Expo, React Native, or Zustand.** We use Kotlin WebView for Android and React Context for state. These were explicitly rejected.
4. **NEVER use Docker or Coolify** on our `t3.micro` EC2. We deploy via bare-metal **PM2 + Nginx** only.
5. **NEVER hardcode colors** (`background: white`, `color: #111`). Use CSS variables: `var(--bg)`, `var(--surface)`, `var(--text)`.
6. **NEVER hardcode pixel values** (`padding: 20px`). Use design tokens: `var(--space-2)`, `var(--radius)`.
7. **NEVER create separate native Android screens.** The Android app is a **WebView shell** loading `app.classgrid.in`. Period.
8. **NEVER auto-redirect login portals on mobile/phone.** Auto-redirect is **Desktop-only**. On phone, if a user logs into the wrong app, the backend **blocks** it with an error.
9. **NEVER import from `src/components/ui/`** for new code — that is the LEGACY folder being phased out. Use `src/components/shadcn/` instead.
10. **NEVER use Supabase Realtime** for chat/presence. We use **Socket.io on EC2** as our primary real-time engine. Supabase is for database (PostgreSQL) only.

### ✅ ALWAYS DO THESE THINGS:
1. **Read this ENTIRE file** before writing any code. It is the Single Source of Truth.
2. **Follow the 4-Step Pipeline** for every new page: Stitch → Figma → Shadcn → Backend.
3. **Use Shadcn components** from `@/components/shadcn/` for all new UI.
4. **Use OKLCH theme tokens** defined in `index.css` for all colors.
5. **Maintain the 3-App separation:** SaaS (Project 1) = brain, Android (Project 3) = thin shell, Marketing (Project 2) = SEO only.
6. **On logout, redirect users back to their role-specific login page** (Student → `/student/login`, Faculty → Faculty Login, Admin → Admin Login).
7. **On Desktop, auto-redirect mismatched roles** (Faculty on Student tab → redirect to Faculty Login). On Mobile, **block instead of redirect**.
8. **JWT sessions:** Mobile = 365 days (long-lived). Desktop = 24 hours (auto-logout) or 7 days with "Remember Me".
9. **Every org uses `orgname.classgrid.in`** (wildcard DNS). React reads `window.location.hostname` to extract the org slug and fetch branding.
10. **Socket.io events** go through the Redis Adapter for multi-node scaling.

### 📁 CRITICAL FILE PATHS:
| File | Purpose | ⚠️ Warning |
|---|---|---|
| `client/src/index.css` | OKLCH theme engine + all design tokens | DO NOT delete or replace. Extend only. |
| `client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` | Auth state + role detection + org context | Core identity file. Edit with extreme care. |
| `server/src/services/socket.service.js` | Socket.io event handlers (rooms, typing, presence) | Must be imported in `server.js` via `initSocket(server)`. |
| `client/src/services/realtime.js` | Client-side real-time bridge (migrating to Socket.io) | Currently being refactored. |
| `info.xml` | Project manifest with Great Rebuild mandate | Read-only reference. |
| `app.xml` | Android app configuration (network security, tokens) | Do not modify without Nikhil's approval. |

## 🔐 Authentication & Unified Login System

The Classgrid login system is designed to be cross-platform, multi-tenant aware, and highly secure.

### 1. The "Three-App" Unity Rule
Although we have three distinct projects, they share a single authentication state:
*   **Single Identity:** A user registered on `app.classgrid.in` is recognized across all three apps.
*   **Project 2 (Marketing) → Project 1 (SaaS):** The marketing site does **not** have its own login. It provides "Login" and "Get Started" buttons that link to `https://app.classgrid.in/login`.
*   **Project 1 (SaaS) ↔ Project 3 (Android):** The Android app is a wrapper for the SaaS app. When a user logs in via the WebView, the session cookie/token is securely stored in the app's persistent storage, keeping them logged in.

### 2. Smart Routing Logic (Mobile vs. Desktop)
To provide the best UX, Classgrid uses high-intelligence routing:
*   **Desktop URL (`/login`):** If a mobile device tries to access this, it is automatically redirected to `/student/login`.
*   **Mobile URL (`/student/login`):** If a desktop user tries to access this, it is automatically redirected back to the main `/login`.
*   **Why?** The desktop login uses a "Full Screen Glassmorphism" layout with a 3D Globe, while the mobile login is a "bottom-sheet" style layout optimized for thumb-reach and one-handed use.

### 3. Login Methods
| Method | Target User | Technology |
|---|---|---|
| **Phone OTP** | Students / Admission | Firebase Auth SDK (Invisible reCAPTCHA) |
| **Google OAuth** | Faculty / Admins | Passport.js + Google Cloud Console |
| **Email/Pass** | Super Admins | JWT + Bcrypt (Legacy Fallback) |

### 4. Technical Flow (The Handshake)
1.  **Request:** User enters phone number. 
2.  **Verify:** Firebase sends a 6-digit OTP. 
3.  **Token Exchange:** Once verified, the client sends the Firebase `idToken` to our Express Backend.
4.  **Backend Auth:** The backend verifies the Firebase token, checks the user in MongoDB, and signs our own **Classgrid JWT**.
5.  **Persistence:** The JWT is stored in an `HttpOnly` secure cookie (prevents XSS attacks).

### 5. Role-Based Smart Redirection & Logout Rules
To maintain the "Three separate apps in one codebase" experience, the following rules apply:

*   **Logout Persistence:** 
    - When a **Student** logs out, the system **must** redirect them to the **Mobile-Optimized Student Login** (`/student/login`).
    - When a **Faculty** member logs out, they land on the **Faculty Login** page.
    - When an **Org Admin** logs out, they land on the **Org-Admin Login** page.
*   **Desktop-Only Cross-Portal Auto-Redirects:**
    - **Faculty Detection:** If a Faculty member tries to log in on the **Student** tab on Desktop, the system detects the role and **auto-redirects** them to the Faculty Login.
    - **Org Admin Detection:** If an Org Admin tries to log in on the **Faculty** portal on Desktop, they are **auto-redirected** to the Org-Admin Login.
    - **Phone Rule (Strict Blocking):** On mobile apps (WebView APKs), auto-redirect is **DISABLED**. Because they are distributed as separate apps, if a user logs into the wrong app (e.g., a Student downloads and tries to log into the Faculty App), the backend MUST block the login and return an error (`"Unauthorized: Please download the Student App"`). This strictly prevents students from using faculty tools.
*   **The "App Context" Constraint:** 
    - In our 3-app ecosystem (Project 1, 2, and 3), once a user is inside the "Student App" (Project 3/WebView), the logout must **never** take them to a higher-level organizational login. It must stay in the Student context.
    - This is enforced by the **Backend Role-Check Middleware** before every login session is finalized.

### 6. Subdomain-Driven Multi-Tenancy (DNS & Dynamic Branding)
Because we use a single, common SaaS codebase and a single set of Mobile APKs for all institutions, we resolve organization context dynamically via subdomains:
*   **DNS Configuration:** A Wildcard DNS `A Record` (`*.classgrid.in`) must be configured at the domain registrar to point to the EC2 Elastic IP.
*   **Desktop Login (URL Detection):** When users go to `pccoe.classgrid.in`, the React frontend reads `window.location.hostname`. It extracts the `pccoe` subdomain and sends it to the backend (`GET /api/org/branding?subdomain=pccoe`).
*   **Dynamic UI Updates:** The login page instantly renders that specific organization's custom **Logo**, **Name**, and **Theme Colors** without needing separate deployments.
*   **Mobile App Resolution:** Because the Android app is a common APK distributed on the PlayStore, users don't have a URL bar. Instead, upon entering their Phone Number (Firebase OTP) or clicking "Login with Google", the backend automatically queries MongoDB (`Organizations`) to detect which institution they belong to and applies the branding and context instantly.

### 7. Session Expiry & Security (Auto-Logout Rules)
We implement different session lifetimes depending on the platform to balance convenience and security (since desktop computers are often shared in labs/libraries):
*   **Mobile Apps (Project 3):** Long-lived sessions. The JWT is set to expire after **365 days** or upon manual logout. Mobile devices are personal and protected by OS lock screens, so forcing re-login is bad UX.
*   **Desktop/Web (Project 1):** Short-lived sessions. The JWT is set to expire after **24 hours** (or 7 days if "Remember Me" is checked). Once expired, the backend automatically rejects the cookie, forcing an **Auto-Logout**, dropping the user safely back on the branded login screen.

---

### Shared Infrastructure (AWS EC2)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Nginx** | Reverse proxy + subdomain routing + SSL |
| **PM2** | Process manager (auto-restart, clustering) |
| **Certbot** | Free wildcard HTTPS (Let's Encrypt) |
| **AWS S3** | File storage (PDFs, images, videos) |
| **Socket.io** | **Primary Real-time Engine** (Chat, Typing, Presence) |
| **Supabase** | PostgreSQL + Row-Level Security |
| **MongoDB** | Document data (NoSQL) |
| **Redis** | **Socket.io Adapter** (Multi-node scaling) + Attendance queue |

## 🏛️ The 5 Organizational Plans (Backend Logic)

| Plan | Type | Key Logic |
|---|---|---|
| **Plan 1** | College | Requires `semester_id` + `academic_year_id` + `division_id` |
| **Plan 2** | School + Divisions | Grade 10 → Division A, B, C underneath |
| **Plan 3** | School (No Divisions) | Auto-creates hidden "Default Division" silently |
| **Plan 4** | Coaching Classes | Blocks divisions entirely → uses "Batches" under "Courses" |
| **Plan 5** | Junior College (11 & 12 only) | API enforces grade boundary (403 if Grade 10 attempted) |

**Frontend Execution:** `AuthContext` reads `structure_type` from JWT → Sidebar dynamically hides/shows "Divisions" vs "Batches" tab.

---

## 🚨 Strict Rules & Commandments

> **THE 4 SAAS COMMANDMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
> 1. **CONSISTENCY** — Same spacing, colors, button style on EVERY page (Shadcn + Tailwind + clsx).
> 2. **UX FLOW** — 1 click + drag & drop + toast. NOT 5 clicks through 3 modals (React Dropzone + Sonner).
> 3. **PERFORMANCE** — Fast loading, no lag, instant feedback (TanStack Query + React.lazy + caching).
> 4. **MICRO-INTERACTIONS** — Hover animations, smooth transitions, loading skeletons. Never blank screens (Framer Motion).

> **THE FERRARI RULE (Phased Library Approach):**
> - **Phase 1 (Build First):** Shadcn UI, Tailwind, TanStack Query, React Hook Form, Zod, Lucide, Sonner, clsx + tailwind-merge
> - **Phase 2 (Enhance):** CMDK, Vaul, TanStack Table, React Dropzone, Embla Carousel
> - **Phase 3 (Polish):** Shadcn Charts (Recharts), Aceternity UI, @dnd-kit, React PDF, Framer Motion (advanced), date-fns, next-themes

> **THE GREAT REBUILD PIPELINE (Mandatory for all pages except Home):**
> 1. **STITCH** → Theme/OKLCH tokens
> 2. **FIGMA** → Layout/Spacing
> 3. **SHADCN** → Assemble from `@/components/shadcn/`
> 4. **BACKEND** → Wire APIs + React Router + Context

> **Architecture Separation:**
> - `src/components/shadcn/` → Raw UI primitives (47+ components)
> - `src/components/aceternity/` → Animation components (4 components)
> - `src/components/features/` → Business logic components
> - `src/components/ui/` → LEGACY (being phased out)

> **The 3-App Architecture Law:**
> 1. **Project 1 (SaaS Platform):** The brain and heart. ALL features, login logic, and dashboards live HERE. Mobile-responsiveness is mandatory.
> 2. **Project 3 (Android Wrapper):** **STRICTLY a WebView shell.** Never build separate native screens. It must load `app.classgrid.in` directly to maintain a "Single Source of Truth."
> 3. **Project 2 (Marketing Site):** Completely decoupled for SEO. It only handles acquisition—any "Login" or "Get Started" buttons must point back to Project 1.

> **Animation Rules:**
> - Marketing Site → Full cinema (3D Globe, Marquees, Scroll effects)
> - SaaS Platform → Subtle only (modal slides, skeleton loaders, NO looping 3D)

> **Rejected Tools:** Expo, React Native, TypeScript rewrite, Zustand, Coolify, Vercel

> **CSS Design Rules (Never Allow List):**
> - ❌ NO hardcoded colors (`background: white;`). Use `var(--bg)`, `var(--surface)`, `var(--text)`.
> - ❌ NO hardcoded pixel values (`padding: 20px;`). Use `var(--space-2)`, `var(--radius)`.
> - ❌ NO raw layout divs. Use `<Page>`, `<Card>`, `<Button>` components.
> - ❌ NO manual `@media` queries unless for custom charts.

## 🏛️ Why AWS EC2 (NOT Vercel)

| Problem on Vercel | Solution on EC2 |
|---|---|
| WebSockets/Socket.io instantly fail (functions die after request) | EC2 runs 24/7 — Socket.io connections stay open permanently |
| 10-second timeout kills PDF generation, bulk emails, student promotions | No timeout — heavy operations run to completion |
| Every request spins a new Node process → exhausts MongoDB connection pool | Single persistent DB pool — 10,000 requests share one connection |
| No native cron jobs for midnight attendance or weekly digests | `node-cron` runs reliably on the persistent server |

---

## 💳 Automated Demo & Expiry System (SaaS Workflow)

1. **Org Creation:** User starts demo on `classgrid.in` → System generates slug `pccoe`, provisions `pccoe.classgrid.in`.
2. **Automated Limits:** `plan: 'demo'`, `isPaid: false`, `expiresAt: +30 days`.
3. **Razorpay Checkout:** On payment → `plan: 'premium'`, `isPaid: true`, `expiresAt: null`. **Do NOT create a new org — reuse the same subdomain.**
4. **TTL Deletion:** If demo expires → Read-Only toggle for 7-day grace period → After that, backend worker cascading-deletes all data for that `org_id`.

---

## ⚡ Real-Time Chat Engine (Redis Streams + Socket.io)

### Architecture: Zero-Loss Messaging
1. User sends message → Hits **Redis Stream** (`chat:stream:org_123`).
2. Socket.io broadcasts to clients (**Optimistic UI** — message appears "gray").
3. Adaptive Worker pulls from stream:
```
try {
  await mongo.insertMany(messages);
  redis.ack(messages);           // Only delete from Redis if MongoDB succeeds
  socket.emit('message_saved');  // Message turns "blue/delivered"
} catch (e) {
  retryQueue();                  // Redis keeps data safely buffered
}
```
4. **Tenant Isolation:** Every org has its own Redis stream (`chat:stream:org_123`) to prevent the "Noisy Neighbor" problem.
5. **Adaptive Workers:** Triggered dynamically by queue size (Emergency Flush when `redisSize > 80%`), not rigid `setInterval`.

# 👑 THE GRAND EXECUTION ORDER (BACKEND-FIRST)
**Generated by Sorra AI after reading every line of the Master Plan, `info.xml`, `app.xml`, Admission Plan, and Canteen Plan.**

> **STRATEGY:** Build ALL backend systems first. Test everything via Postman on localhost. Only after every API returns correct JSON do we touch the frontend CSS/Shadcn rebuild.

### 🚀 THE COMPLETE BACKEND-FIRST SCHEDULE

#### 🗓️ DAY 1: The 7 Organizational Plans — Identity & Platform Splitting
**Objective:** Transform Classgrid into a 4-path Identity Engine (Engineering, School, Coaching, Jr College).

| Plan | Type | Hierarchy Structure | Key Backend Logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Plan 1** | College / Engineering | `Degree → Dept → Year → Sem → Div/Batch` | Requires `semester_id` + `division_id` |
| **Plan 2** | School (With Div) | `Standard → Division` | Grade + Division structure |
| **Plan 3** | School (No Div) | `Standard` only | Auto-creates hidden "Default Division" |
| **Plan 4** | Coaching Classes | `Course → Batch` | Blocks divisions & semesters entirely. |
| **Plan 5** | Junior College | `Stream → Standard → Division` | Enforces 11th/12th grade boundary |
| **Plan 6** | Diploma | `Dept → Year → Semester` | No Degree layer, Semester-locked |
| **Plan 7** | Other (Custom) | Open-ended grouping | Flexible, user-defined hierarchy |

- [x] Build `AcademicHierarchy.model.js` with `structure_type` and `allow_sub_batches` for Lab splitting.
- [x] **Atomic Email Reservation:** Unique DB indexing + "Pending" status to prevent race conditions during generation.
- [x] **BullMQ Provisioning:** Move Google/Zoho API calls to a background worker (3x retry logic) for zero-wait UI.
- [x] Write dynamic parser middleware: If a Coaching class requests "Semesters" → `400 Bad Request`.
- [x] Wire `AuthContext` to read `structure_type` from JWT → Frontend Sidebar hides/shows "Divisions" vs "Batches".
- [x] Test every plan via Postman: Create Org → Verify allowed/blocked nested routes.

#### 🗓️ DAY 2: Subdomain Multi-Tenant Engine & Dynamic Branding
**Master Plan §6 (line 284-289): DNS + Dynamic Logo/Theme fetching.**
- [x] Configure Wildcard DNS `A Record` (`*.classgrid.in`) pointing to EC2 Elastic IP.
- [x] Create `SubdomainRouter.middleware.js`: Extract `pccoe` from `pccoe.classgrid.in` via `req.headers.host`.
- [x] Build `GET /api/org/branding?subdomain=pccoe` → Returns org Logo, Name, Theme Colors.
- [x] Cache org lookups in Redis (so we don't hit MongoDB per request).
- [x] Mobile App Resolution: On login, backend auto-detects org from user's Phone/Google → applies branding.

#### 🗓️ DAY 3: "Login Law" — Smart Routing + Logout Persistence
**Master Plan §2-§5 (lines 249-283): The complete cross-platform auth ruleset.**
- [x] Upgrade `auth.middleware.js` to read `x-platform-app` header (sent by Android WebView).
- [x] **Desktop Auto-Redirect:** Faculty on Student tab → redirect to Faculty Login. Org Admin on Faculty tab → redirect to Admin Login.
- [x] **Mobile HARD BLOCK:** Student in Faculty APK → `403 "Unauthorized: Please download the Student App"`. NO redirect on mobile.
- [x] **Logout Persistence:** Student logout → `/student/login`. Faculty logout → Faculty Login. Admin logout → Admin Login. Never cross contexts.
- [x] **Session Expiry:** Mobile JWT = 365 days. Desktop JWT = 24 hours (7 days w/ "Remember Me").
- [x] Test all 6 scenarios via Postman with mocked headers.

#### 🗓️ DAY 4: SaaS Demo & Expiry System + Subscription Engine
**Master Plan §SaaS Workflow (lines 573-578) + Module Provisioning.**
- [x] Build `OrgSubscription.model.js`: `plan: 'demo' | 'free' | 'core' | 'premium' | 'enterprise'`.
- [x] Build Demo Provisioning: `POST /api/org/demo` → auto-generate slug, set `expiresAt: +30 days`.
- [x] **Slug Selector Logic:** Auto-generate unique subdomain from Name (already built into the service).
- [x] Build `ModuleToggle.service.js`: Dynamically enable/disable features per plan (e.g., Schools get Attendance + Marks, Engineering gets SGPA + Placements).
- [x] **Super Admin UI:** Form for manual tenant kickoff (provisioning dashboard).

#### 🗓️ DAY 5: Socket.io Migration & Redis Chat Architecture
**Master Plan §Real-Time Chat Engine (lines 582-598): Zero-Loss Messaging.**
- [x] Replace Supabase Realtime with native Socket.io on EC2.
- [x] Hook up `socket.io-redis` adapter for PM2 multi-node scaling.
- [x] Implement Redis Streams architecture: `chat:stream:org_123` per tenant.
- [x] Build Adaptive Worker: `mongo.insertMany(messages)` → `redis.ack()` → `socket.emit('message_saved')`.
- [x] Build Emergency Flush: When `redisSize > 80%`, trigger immediate batch dump.
- [x] Test: 2 clients on different PM2 instances can exchange messages without loss.

#### 🗓️ DAY 6: Security & Rate Limiting + Observability
**Master Plan §Security (lines 193-201) + §Observability (line 350).**
- [x] Implement express-rate-limit on ALL sensitive endpoints:
      - `POST /api/auth/otp/send` → 5 req/phone/hr
      - `POST /api/auth/login` → no limit 
      - `POST /api/chat/send` → 200 msg/min
