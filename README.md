Classgrid Platform Desktop is the private monorepo for the Classgrid education operating system. It combines a React web application, an Express API, shared packages, mobile/Android workspaces, and deployment assets for running the platform across development, Vercel, and AWS EC2 environments.

This codebase contains business logic, product strategy, platform architecture, and integration code owned by Classgrid. Do not copy, redistribute, mirror, sell, sublicense, or publish any part of this repository without written permission from Classgrid.

## Product Scope

Classgrid is built for institutions that need one connected platform for teaching, learning, admissions, administration, communication, automation, and analytics. The platform includes classroom management, attendance, notes, assignments, live and recorded learning, admissions workflows, fees, payroll, canteen operations, support, public organization websites, AI-assisted academic tools, internal admin operations, and real-time communication.

The system is designed as a multi-tenant platform. Organizations can operate with separate users, roles, academic structures, classroom data, public pages, and operational workflows while sharing a common platform backend and frontend shell.

### Install

```bash
npm run install:all
```

### Run full stack

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the backend and frontend from the root workspace using the existing root scripts.

### Run individually

```bash
npm run dev:server
npm run dev:client
```

### Build frontend

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### Start backend directly

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

## EC2 Deployment Notes

The backend is designed to run on AWS EC2 as a Node.js service managed by PM2. A typical production EC2 setup is:

```text
User: ubuntu
Application path: /home/ubuntu/classgrid/current
Backend path: /home/ubuntu/classgrid/current/server
PM2 app name: classgrid
Backend port: 3000
Health check: http://localhost:3000/api/health
Logs: /home/ubuntu/classgrid/logs and server/logs
```

Recommended EC2 production flow:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/classgrid/current
git pull origin main

cd server
npm ci --production
pm2 reload ecosystem.config.cjs --env production --update-env
pm2 save
```

Recommended Nginx shape:

```text
HTTPS request
-> Nginx reverse proxy
-> http://127.0.0.1:3000
-> Express API
```

Operational checks after deployment:

```bash
pm2 status
pm2 logs classgrid --lines 50
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Environment setup on EC2:

- Keep `server/.env` on the EC2 machine only.
- Do not place production secrets in GitHub, README files, screenshots, issue comments, or commit messages.
- Rotate credentials immediately if a secret is ever exposed.
- Keep Nginx, PM2, Node.js, and system packages updated.
- Use HTTPS for public traffic and keep security groups limited to required ports.

## Git and Source-Control Rules

- This repository is private and proprietary.
- Do not commit `.env`, secret JSON, private keys, generated logs, build outputs, or temporary screenshots.
- Review `git status --short` before every commit.
- Use `git check-ignore -v server/.env` before pushing when working near backend secrets.
- Prefer small, meaningful commits when possible.
- Use clear commit messages that describe product or engineering changes without exposing credentials.

## Conduct and Collaboration

All authorized collaborators must follow the [Classgrid Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It covers professional collaboration, confidentiality, secret handling, private-repository access, security escalation, and enforcement expectations for Classgrid work.

## Deployment Targets

The codebase supports multiple runtime surfaces:

- Local development from the monorepo root
- Vite frontend builds from `client/`
- Node/Express backend from `server/`
- EC2 backend runtime with PM2 and Nginx
- Vercel-style frontend or API deployment surfaces where configured
- Expo/EAS mobile builds from `mobile/`

## Security Checklist

Before pushing or deploying:

- Confirm `server/.env` is ignored.
- Confirm no secret values appear in staged files.
- Confirm no service-account JSON, PEM, private key, or local token file is staged.
- Confirm production environment variables are set on EC2 or the deployment platform.
- Confirm `NODE_ENV=production` for production backend runtime.
- Confirm `/api/health` returns a healthy response after deploy.
