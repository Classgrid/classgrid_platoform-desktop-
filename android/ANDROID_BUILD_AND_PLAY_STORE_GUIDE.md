# 📱 How to Build the 3 Apps & Pass Google Play Review

This guide explains how to generate your 3 separate APKs (Student, Faculty, Admin) from this single codebase, and the rules we followed to ensure Google Play approves your WebView app.

## 🏗️ PART 1: How to Generate the 3 Apps (APKs/AABs)

Because we used **Build Flavors** in your `build.gradle.kts`, you have 3 apps inside 1 project. Here is how you export them from Android Studio:

### For Testing Locally (Debug APK)
1. Open the `android` folder in Android Studio.
2. On the left side of Android Studio, click the **"Build Variants"** tab (usually bottom-left).
3. You will see a dropdown for the `app` module. You can choose:
   - `studentDebug` (Builds the Student App)
   - `facultyDebug` (Builds the Faculty App)
   - `adminDebug`   (Builds the Admin App)
4. Select the one you want, and hit the **Green Play Button** to install it on your phone.

### For Uploading to Google Play Store (Release Bundle)
Google Play requires an `.aab` (Android App Bundle) file, not an `.apk`.
1. In Android Studio, go to top menu: **Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK...**
2. Select **Android App Bundle** -> click Next.
3. Choose your Keystore (you will create one during this process) -> click Next.
4. **THE IMPORTANT STEP:** It will ask which "Flavors" you want to build. 
   - Check `studentRelease`
   - Check `facultyRelease`
   - Check `adminRelease`
5. Click **Finish**. Android Studio will generate 3 separate `.aab` files. You upload these 3 files to 3 different App Listings on your Google Play Console!

## 🛡️ PART 2: Google Play Store Approval Rules (Why we won't get rejected)

Google actively rejects "WebView-only" apps that behave like simple websites. **Here is why your app will BE APPROVED**, because we added these native features:

### 1. The OAuth / Google Login Rule (SOLVED ✅)
*   **Rule:** Google rejects apps that open Google Sign-In inside a WebView because it's a security risk.
*   **Our Solution:** We implemented **Native Google One Tap**. The sign-in happens using the phone's native Android UI (the Instagram-style bottom sheet), and we pass the secure token back to React via the JavaScript Bridge.

### 2. The Back Button Rule (SOLVED ✅)
*   **Rule:** If a user presses the physical back button on their Android phone, the app should navigate to the previous page, NOT close the app entirely.
*   **Our Solution:** We intercepted the native `onBackPressed` in `MainActivity.kt`. If the WebView has a history, it goes back in React Router. If it's at the root `/`, it confirms before closing.

### 3. External Links Rule (SOLVED ✅)
*   **Rule:** If a user clicks a Zoom link, Google Meet link, or Razorpay payment, it should not get trapped inside the WebView.
*   **Our Solution:** In our `shouldOverrideUrlLoading`, we explicitly detect `zoom.us`, `meet.google.com`, and `razorpay.com`. If tapped, the Kotlin code forces opening the phone's default external browser (like Chrome), ensuring payments and meetings never break.

### 4. Native Device Features (SOLVED ✅)
*   **Rule:** An app must feel like an app, utilizing device hardware.
*   **Our Solution:** 
    - Native Push Notifications (Firebase)
    - Native Biometric Login (Fingerprint/FaceID via `androidx.biometric`)
    - Native Haptic Feedback / Vibrations (triggered via JS Bridge)
    - Edge-to-Edge full screen layout (no ugly white status bars)

### ⚠️ Final Checklist Before Submitting to Play Store:
1. Ensure your website (`app.classgrid.in`) has a visible **Privacy Policy** page. Google Play requires a link to it.
2. In the Play Console, when it asks for Data Safety, you MUST declare that you collect Email/Names for Account Management.
3. Make sure to update the App Icons in `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap...` replacing the default Android logos with your highly aesthetic Classgrid logos!
