# 🚀 Progress: Day 11 & 12 — Admission Engine Foundation

## 📅 DAY 11: Foundation — Unified Schema & Identity Split
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Key Accomplishments:
1.  **Organization Model Extended**: 
    *   Added `admission_config` subdocument to track portal status, registration fees, and instructions per organization.
2.  **Unified Admission Application Model**: 
    *   Built a comprehensive `AdmissionApplication.js` schema that handles both Engineering (CET-based) and Non-Engineering (Direct/Merit-based) flows.
    *   Includes `stage_history`, `documents` checklist, `merit_score`, and `waitlist` tracking.
3.  **Seat Configuration Model**: 
    *   Created `SeatConfig.js` to manage multi-tenant dynamic capacity per course/branch/standard.
4.  **Supabase Mirror & RLS**: 
    *   Created `SUPABASE_ADMISSION_ENGINE_MIGRATION.sql` to provide a secure Postgres layer for Parent Portal lookups and high-frequency live merit list polling.

## 📅 DAY 12: Workflow Engine & Dynamic Form Builder
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Key Accomplishments:
1.  **State Machine Logic**: 
    *   Implemented `admission-workflow.service.js` to manage strict application lifecycle transitions (`Draft` → `Applied` → `Verified` → `Enrolled`).
2.  **Dynamic Form Engine**: 
    *   Built `admission-form-builder.service.js` which generates a JSON form schema tailored to the organization's structure type (Engineering vs school vs coaching).
3.  **Admin Configuration API**: 
    *   Built `admission-config.controller.js` to allow admins to toggle portals, set fees, and inject standard presets with a single click.
4.  **Route Infrastructure**: 
    *   Registered all admission endpoints under `/api/admission/...` including public auth and admin config routes.
